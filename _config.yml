about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am an interdisciplinary researcher dedicated to designing and fabricating morphologically tailored nanomaterials for bifunctional electrocatalysis in water splitting applications. My work focuses on enhancing the performance of transition metal-based systems through strategic modifications, including heterojunction formation, doping, and other advanced techniques, and I utilize density functional theory (DFT) calculations to gain detailed insights into the structural and electronic properties of the materials.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Nanomaterial synthesis</mark>, <mark>Data analysis and Interpretation</mark>,<mark> Microsoft Windows and Linux</mark> and <mark>Shell Scripting</mark>

  My Areas of Interest: <mark>Photoelectrocatalysis</mark>, <mark>Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</mark>,<mark> Heterostructure Architecture</mark>, <mark>Nanomaterial synthesis and structural engineering</mark> and <mark>Density Functional Theory</mark>

  Technical Tools and Software: <mark>Origin</mark>, <mark>Xâ€™Pert HighScore Plus</mark>, <mark>GSAS</mark>, <mark>CasaXPS</mark>, <mark>ImageJ</mark>, <mark>EC-lab</mark>, <mark>Quantum Espresso</mark>, <mark>OrigaMaster</mark>, <mark>Materials Studio</mark>, <mark>VESTA </mark> and <mark>VASP</mark>

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
